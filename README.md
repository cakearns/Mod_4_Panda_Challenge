Mod 4 Panda Challenge

Used Pandas and Jupyter notebook for this challenge

District Summary
Created a DataFrame to create output with the following:
* total schools
* total students
* total budget
* average math score
* average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
Created a DataFrane to summarize the key metrics:
* school name
* school type
* total students
* total school budget
* per student budget
* average math score
* average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Created a Dataframe with key metrics:
* school name
* school type
* total school budget
* per student budget
* average math score
* average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Lowest-Permforming Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Created a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

Math Scores by Grade 
Created a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

Reading Scores by Grade
Created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

Scores by School Spending 
Created a table that broke down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student)using the following metrics:
* average math score
* average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Scores by School Size
Created a table that broke down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)

Scores by School Type
